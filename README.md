# Data_handling_pandas

This analysis is based on a freelance project.

Sensitive variables were masked.

This projectÂ is divided into 2 main parts:

- Cleaning and expanding the data
- Apply basic statistics

I am using Python programming language and libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn.
